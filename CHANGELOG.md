# 2.0.4
## Fixes
- Ruff checks extended, tightened, and fixes applied
- OTel formatting handles infinity correctly
- Dependencies updated
# 2.0.3
## Fixes
- Prevent `state_changed` event handling mutating event data and interfering with subsequent handlers
# 2.0.2
## Fixes
- Fixed test issues on CI, and improve HA async compatibility for log event handler
# 2.0.1
## Fixes
- Validation could fail with a 422 because of the empty payload when used with Loki, this status code is now taken to
reflect remote service is available and authenticated
# 2.0.0
## Root Log Handler
- New way to capture logs at any level
  - `system_log_event` based logging is clean but limited to WARN and ERROR levels
    - System Log Event usage requires a YAML change to fire event
  - Config now has a choice of using Python root logger
    - Configurable to a minimum log level (default `INFO` can be `DEBUG` if needed) which captures all logging
    - Reuses same logic as System Log to tie back exceptions to source code
# 1.6.0
## py3.13 and py3.14
- Automated testing and linting is done for both Python 3.13 ( with the corresponding 2026.2 max Home Assistant version) and Python 3.14 with the latest Home Assistant public release
## Home Assistant Event improvements
- Corrected name of `repairs_issue_registry_updated`
- Improved description of core changes and serializing JSON
- Automation and script events generate title now only with entity_id for clarity and consistency with other events
- Tidied up ConfigFlow UI for Home Assistant standard events
- Defined message titles for all the device/entity/label/floor etc registries
- `system_log_event` is usually suppressed as an event name, since its noisy in a purely logging context. It can now optionally be emitted like any other event name, helpful if remote_logger being used more as a HA event store
# 1.5.5
- Logging improvements - log each custom event subscribed, and more consistency for log prefix
# 1.5.4
- Switch event names to multi value rather than multi-line and remove comma separation
- Use multi-value also for custom header configuration
# 1.5.3
- Accept comma separated custom event names
# 1.5.2
- Remote Logger devices can be renamed in the UI without being replaced by a new device with default identifier
- Suppress error message when aiohttp session is force closed by HA at shutdown
- Switch off buffer at shutdown so all logs captured
# 1.5.1
- For JSON, send integers as strings if they're not representable as signed 32 bit values, to meet limitations of JSON, and align with OTLP spec
- For JSON, suppress empty attributes and NaaN float values
# 1.5.0
- Timeout for remote posting now configurable, defaults to old hard-coded value 10
- OLTP JSON now in camel case, to suit strict interpretation by some log aggregators, and corrected handling of float/null values
- Added action to manually trigger log flush
- Added action to return the last posted submission to remote log service
- Fix switch from protobuf to JSON for an existing logger
# 1.4.9
- Flush logs to remote back end on all 3 of the Home Assistant closing events
# 1.4.8
- Translations for Dutch, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Simplified Chinese and Spanish
- Vertalingen voor Nederlands, Traductions en français, Übersetzungen auf Deutsch, हिंदी में अनुवाद, Traduzioni in italiano, 日本語の翻訳, Tłumaczenia po polsku, Traduções em português, 简体中文翻译 en traducciones al español
